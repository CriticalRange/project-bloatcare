## Project info

- First things first, this is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

- Second, this is my first proper next.js project. So please be kind :)

## Want to help develop this? (I would like to have some ideas from you)

First, download the dependencies:

```bash
# node:
npm install
# or if you like microsoft:
yarn install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
# with node:
npm run dev
# or yarn:
yarn dev
# or if you use pnpm:
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (if you didn't change the port) within your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the pages. The page auto-updates as you edit the file thanks to hot-reload feature.
