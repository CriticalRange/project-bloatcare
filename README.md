# A Blog app that you can enjoy

First, this is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Second, this is my first proper next.js project.

## Want to help develop this?

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or if you like microsoft:
yarn dev
# or if you use pnpm:
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (if you didn't change the port) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the pages. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
